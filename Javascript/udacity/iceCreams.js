/*
 * Programming Quiz: Ice Cream (3-6)
 *
 * Write a single if statement that logs out the message:
 * 
 * "I'd like two scoops of __________ ice cream in a __________ with __________."
 * 
 * ...only if:
 *   - flavor is "vanilla" or "chocolate"
 *   - vessel is "cone" or "bowl"
 *   - toppings is "sprinkles" or "peanuts"
 *
 * We're only testing the if statement and your boolean operators. 
 * It's okay if the output string doesn't match exactly.
 */

/*

 * 1. Your code should have the variables `flavor`, `vessel`, and `toppings`
 * 2. Your code should have an `if` statement
 * 3. Your code should use logical expressions
 * 4. Your code should work with 
 *  - `flavor=vanilla`, `vessel=cone`, and `toppings=sprinkles`
 *  - `flavor=vanilla`, `vessel=cone`, and `toppings=peanuts`
 *  - `flavor=vanilla`, `vessel=bowl`, and `toppings=sprinkles`
